# Deciphering the Enigma: An Integrated Computational Pipeline for the Voynich Manuscript

This repository contains an integrated computational pipeline designed to tackle the enduring mystery of the Voynich Manuscript—a 240‑page codex of mysterious illustrations and undeciphered text. Our approach combines state‑of‑the‑art transformer models, evolutionary algorithms, network clustering, multimodal image‑text integration, and expert heuristic post‑processing to generate a unified candidate translation.

## Overview

The pipeline is divided into several key modules:
- **Data Acquisition and Pre‑Processing:** High‑resolution multispectral scans from Yale’s Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library are processed using deep learning‑based OCR tailored to the Extensible Voynich Alphabet (EVA). The text is segmented into thematic sections (botanical, astronomical, balneological, pharmaceutical, recipes) using a fine‑tuned ResNet‑50 model.
- **Transformer-Based AI Module:** Synthetic parallel data is generated by “Voynich‑izing” sentences from a comparative corpus of medieval texts. Transformer models (GPT‑2 and T5) are fine‑tuned on this data using a curriculum learning strategy.
- **Evolutionary Algorithm Module:** Candidate mappings of Voynich glyphs to Latin syllables are optimized using an evolutionary algorithm implemented with DEAP. The fitness function integrates frequency matching, syntactic coherence (using pretrained medieval Latin models), and simulated expert feedback.
- **Network and Multimodal Integration:** A co‑occurrence network of the transcribed text is constructed and clustered (using Louvain and spectral methods) to identify recurring thematic groups. A CLIP‑like model projects both text and manuscript images into a shared vector space to verify thematic alignment.
- **Expert Heuristic Post‑Processing:** Rule‑based corrections are applied based on a comprehensive database of medieval Latin grammar and common abbreviations. Automated expert scoring simulates human feedback to further refine candidate translations.
- **External Validation:** Statistical metrics (conditional entropy, Zipf’s law adherence, MATTR, topic coherence) and paleographic consistency checks validate our outputs against verified medieval texts.
